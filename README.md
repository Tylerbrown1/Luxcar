This is a request a ride application. It allows users to sign in (using Google OAuth API).
From there I used Google Places API to allow users to enter in their exact location of where they want to be picked up and what time. 
From there the user can selected a car of their choice.
Then the user is taken to see the total price and pictures of the car they have chosen.
Lastly, the user has the option to cancel their ride. 
The user also can see their rides they have ordered and previous ones.
